# Guile Docker

Guile compiled with [bindings for GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org/manual/gnutls-guile.pdf) and all dependencies needed for HTTPS support in [Web Client](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Web-Client.html).

Planning to add more of my favorite packages and tools for Guile development here.
