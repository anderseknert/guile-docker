# Guile Docker

Guile compiled with [bindings for GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org/manual/gnutls-guile.pdf) and all dependencies needed 
for HTTPS support in [Web Client](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Web-Client.html). Why this isn't
included in the normal Guile distribution beats me - being able to use a HTTP client seems like a pretty basic 
requirement for any language and standard library these days. Ubuntu used to include the 
[guile-gnutls](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/guile-gnutls) package in it's universe repository up until version 
16.04 LTS (mirroring Debian) - why this package was pulled from later releases I don't know but 


Planning to add more of my favorite packages and tools for Guile development here.
